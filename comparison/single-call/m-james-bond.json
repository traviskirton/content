      "title": "Background",
      "body": "**M** is the codename used for the director of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). The character has been portrayed by several individuals in the James Bond franchise, with the original literary character often named Sir Miles Messervy. Generally depicted as a career intelligence officer and a high-ranking official in the British government, M oversees MI6 operations and directs agents such as James Bond. The role has evolved across novels and films to reflect different leadership styles and periods in British intelligence history. For example, in later films, the character’s name is revealed as Gareth Mallory.\n\nThe background often highlights M's extensive experience in espionage and politics, with a distinguished career that commands respect from subordinates and the British government alike."

      "title": "Personality",
      "body": "- **Authoritative and disciplined:** M embodies the strict discipline and professionalism expected of a spy chief.\n- **Pragmatic and practical:** Balances national security concerns with the risks and collateral damage of espionage.\n- **Protective yet demanding:** Shows concern for agents like Bond but expects high standards and results.\n- **Wry and occasionally sarcastic:** Often uses dry wit, especially in interactions with Bond.\n- **Stubborn and cautious:** Sometimes skeptical of Bond's unorthodox methods but ultimately trusts his effectiveness.\n\nM’s motivations revolve around protecting the United Kingdom’s interests, maintaining order within MI6, and managing the complex geopolitical threats the agency faces. Flaws include occasional rigidity, political expediency, and emotional restraint that distances M from personal connections."
