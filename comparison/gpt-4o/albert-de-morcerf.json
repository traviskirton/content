From a young age, Albert was given every advantage of education and refinement, becoming a well-mannered young man, though perhaps a bit naive due to his sheltered upbringing."

He is well-liked and sociable, showing a sense of honor and fairness. His era's aristocratic lifestyle can sometimes cloud his judgment, making him initially blind to the flaws of those around him."
