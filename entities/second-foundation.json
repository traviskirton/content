      "title": "Overview",
      "body": "The Second Foundation is a covert organization established by Hari Seldon, located at 'Star's End,' dedicated to safeguarding and guiding the Seldon Plan through the use of advanced psychological and mental sciences. Unlike the First Foundation, which relies on physical sciences and technology, the Second Foundation manipulates the political and social order from the shadows with unparalleled mental abilities."

      "title": "Structure",
      "body": "Comprising elite mentalics known as psychologists or telepaths, the Second Foundation operates as a centralized, secretive group.

    {
      "title": "History",
      "body": "The Second Foundation was created concurrently with the First Foundation as part of Hari Seldon's grand psychohistorical scheme to shorten the period of galactic chaos after the fall of the Galactic Empire. It remained hidden for centuries, intervening discreetly during critical junctures, particularly during the rise of the Mule and later threats to the project."

    {
      "title": "Goals",
      "body": "Its primary goal is the preservation and fulfillment of the Seldon Plan – an overarching strategy designed to guide the galaxy through inevitable turmoil towards a renewed Empire.
