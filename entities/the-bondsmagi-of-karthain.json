      "body": "The Bondsmagi are a prestigious and secretive guild of sorcerers residing in the great city of Karthain. They are famed for their ability to bind others through magical contracts—literal bonds that are inescapable and enforceable by arcane law. Their influence extends far beyond Karthain, as their services are sought by nobles, merchants, and rulers alike desperate for magical enforcement and protection."

Membership is highly selective, restricted to those who demonstrate extraordinary magical talent and loyalty to the guild’s codes. The Bondsmagi's inner workings remain deliberately opaque to outsiders, and speculation abounds regarding their rituals and governance."
