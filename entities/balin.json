      "body": "Balin is a noble dwarf, younger brother to Dwalin and a member of the royal line of Durin. As one of Thorin Oakenshield’s closest companions, he shares the quest to reclaim Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, and restore the lost dwarven kingdom. Balin’s history is deeply tied to the long heritage of the House of Durin, and after the quest in The Hobbit, he would eventually become Lord of Moria for a time before the events of The Lord of the Rings.
