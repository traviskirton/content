      "body": "Control is a shadowy figure in John le Carré's espionage world, formerly the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, colloquially known as 'the Circus.' His real name is never revealed, reflecting his preference for anonymity. Dedicated to counterintelligence during the Cold War, Control's tenure was defined by paranoia and the frenzy to root out Soviet moles within his own service. His leadership style was secretive and authoritative, often enigmatic to his agents."
