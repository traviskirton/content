Living in Lake-town (Esgaroth), a settlement on the Long Lake, Bard is a respected figure among his people, known for his vigilance against threats from the wilds and the dragon’s menace. His ancestral lineage and connection to the lost kingdom of Dale give him a rightful claim to leadership in the struggle to reclaim the region after Smaug’s death."
