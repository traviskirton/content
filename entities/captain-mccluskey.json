      "title": "Background",
      "body": "Captain McCluskey is a high-ranking officer in the New York Police Department, notable for his corruption and willingness to collude with organized crime figures for personal gain. His position affords him considerable influence, which he uses to provide protection to corrupt elements within the mafia, primarily supporting Virgil Sollozzo’s narcotics operations. McCluskey’s corruption exemplifies the blurred lines between law enforcement and crime during the era."

McCluskey displays a mixture of arrogance and impaired moral judgment, often abusing his power to intimidate or neutralize perceived threats. Despite his aggressive demeanor, he is ultimately a pawn in the larger power struggle."
