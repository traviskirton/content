Born in the early 20th century, he became one of the most feared and respected hitmen within the New York Mafia circles, entrusted with highly delicate and dangerous missions. Brasi’s loyalty to Vito Corleone is absolute, earned through years of service and committed brutality. His blood-soaked reputation and readiness to employ violence both ensured his role as a protector and deterrent for the Corleone interests."
