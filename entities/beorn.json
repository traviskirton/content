      "title": "Background",
      "body": "Beorn is a unique inhabitant of Middle-earth, living in the borderlands near the Misty Mountains. He is descended from a long line of skin-changers who can assume the form of bears, a power he uses to protect his homestead and nearby lands. A solitary figure, Beorn sustains himself and his household through animal husbandry and keeping various livestock. His deep connection to nature and the wilderness places him somewhat apart from the civilized realms of elves, dwarves, and men."

      "body": "Beorn is a strong, taciturn, and somewhat gruff individual, embodying the wildness and power of the natural world. While capable of kindness and hospitality, he is no friend to goblins or orcs and displays fierce territoriality. His aura commands respect and even fear, for he is both protector and warrior. Despite his solitary nature, Beorn forms a respectful and valuable alliance with Gandalf and the company, showing a practical willingness to aid those who oppose darkness."
