      "body": "The Mithril Coat, also known as the Mithril shirt or mailhauberk, is a finely woven chainmail garment crafted from mithril, a legendary and supernaturally strong metal. It was a gift from Bilbo Baggins to Frodo and serves as an exceptional protective armor during perilous journeys in Middle-earth. The coat is light as silk yet more protective than the strongest steel."
