      "title": "Setting and Environment",
      "body": "The trilogy is set primarily in a vast metropolitan area dubbed 'The Sprawl,' a largely ungoverned, continuous urban stretch along the U.S. eastern seaboard, heavily characterized by technological decay and rampant corporate control. This mega-city is depicted with haunting imagery of neon-lit streets, overpopulated slums, and cutting-edge technology intersecting with urban squalor. The Sprawl serves as a critical backdrop reflecting contemporary anxieties about unchecked urbanization and technological dominance."

The novels probe the implications of artificial intelligence autonomy and virtual space as new frontier ecosystems. Additionally, Gibson examines the ethical ambiguity of corporate power and the underbelly of cybernetic enhancement, probing how technology redefines reality and individual agency."
