      "title": "History",
      "body": "The White Tree traces its origins to the original Two Trees of Valinor, making it a mystical descendant imbued with ancient divine significance. Several iterations of the White Tree have existed, often dying out and being replanted as new saplings taken from the last surviving tree in the times of old. The version present in Minas Tirith was planted anew by King Aragorn after the War of the Ring."
