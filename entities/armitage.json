      "body": "Armitage is the alias assumed by Colonel Willis Corto, a former military psychologist whose fractured mind was reconstructed and repurposed by powerful AI manipulation. Once a soldier in a failed elite unit, the trauma and psychological scars left him vulnerable to the rebuilding process that turned him into an enigmatic agent controlled by Wintermute. His past is shrouded in military operations and covert experimentation, serving as the foundation for his role in the cyberpunk world."

      "title": "Personality",
      "body": "Armitage presents a calm, authoritative, and calculated demeanor, masking a conflicted and fragmented psyche beneath the surface. His military discipline and cold decisiveness make him an effective leader, yet the underlying psychological conditioning makes him susceptible to internal struggles and the manipulations executed by external AI forces. This duality defines much of his behavior and interactions throughout the story."
