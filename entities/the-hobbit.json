      "body": "The Hobbit, first published in 1937, is a seminal work in fantasy literature written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It serves as a prelude to the later epic, The Lord of the Rings, and details the journey of a humble hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is thrust into a perilous quest to help a group of dwarves reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug. The novel combines rich world-building, memorable characters, and a narrative that balances adventure, humor, and moments of poignant reflection, making it a cornerstone of the fantasy genre."

      "body": "Bilbo Baggins, a comfort-loving hobbit, is unexpectedly recruited by the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield on a mission to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure hoarded by the dragon Smaug. Along the way, Bilbo encounters trolls, goblins, giant spiders, elves, and men, discovering courage and cunning he never knew he possessed. A pivotal moment is Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, where he acquires the One Ring, setting the stage for future tales.
