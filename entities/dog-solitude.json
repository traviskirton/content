      "title": "Overview",
      "body": "Dog Solitude is an isolated retreat situated on the fringes of the Sprawl, removed from the urban sprawl and corporate surveillance that dominates the main setting of 'Mona Lisa Overdrive'.

The setting includes a secluded house surrounded by dense vegetation and harsh terrain, making physical discovery challenging. The fusion of nature and technology mirrors the thematic juxtaposition of humanity and cybernetic augmentation pervasive throughout the novel."

      "title": "History",
      "body": "Originally established by an unknown figure seeking sanctuary from the conflicting powers of the Sprawl, Dog Solitude has remained off the grid for years. Its history is a deep secret, tied closely to the personal stories of its inhabitants rather than broader geographic or political events. Over time, it has become a nexus for covert meetings and a staging ground for resistance against corporate interests, reflecting the ongoing battle between individual autonomy and oppressive control."

      "title": "Story Significance",
      "body": "Dog Solitude serves as the backdrop for pivotal interactions and turning points in the plot of 'Mona Lisa Overdrive'. The site is a refuge for key characters such as Kumiko Yanaka or others seeking anonymity, where plans are conceived away from prying eyes. Its remote nature provides a contrast to the crowded, technologically saturated spaces elsewhere in the Sprawl, emphasizing themes of isolation, secrecy, and the search for peace in a fractured world. The location’s presence underscores the duality of connection and solitude that defines the cyberpunk ethos."
