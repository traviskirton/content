      "title": "Background",
      "body": "Bug is the youngest member of the Gentleman Bastards, discovered and taken under Father Chains's wing early in his life in Camorr. His past includes survival on the streets, which instilled in him a fierce resilience and cunning. Bug’s upbringing in the city's poorest quarters shaped his resourcefulness and adaptable nature. Over time, he became an integral part of the small but efficient team led by Locke Lamora."

      "title": "Personality",
      "body": "Displaying a combination of loyalty, naivety, and energetic optimism, Bug acts as the spirited heart of the group. While inexperienced compared to others, his enthusiasm and determination to learn make him a valuable asset. His sometimes impulsive behavior is balanced by the mentorship he receives, allowing cracks in his youthful facade to be filled with moments of courage and cleverness."

    {
      "title": "Story Role",
      "body": "Bug serves a crucial role during the Gentleman Bastards’ cons and operations by supporting the team with agility and alertness. His small size and quick reflexes enable him to maneuver through tight situations, scout ahead, or act as a messenger when communication is limited. Although Bug is not a primary decision-maker, his contributions often have significant impact, and his growth is part of the narrative arc that illustrates the passing of the torch within their fraternity."

The group acts as a surrogate family for Bug, providing him with protection and guidance he lacked in his early years. These relationships are key to his character development and integration into the adult world of the Gentleman Bastards."

    {
      "title": "Abilities/Skills",
      "body": "Bug's primary skills lie in agility, stealth, and rapid reflexes that allow him to excel at quick escapes and reconnaissance tasks. He is nimble and physically adept, able to slip through tight spots or evade dangerous confrontations when less skilled members might falter. Additionally, Bug displays growing proficiency in basic traps and minor trickery, all under the tutelage of Locke and Father Chains."
