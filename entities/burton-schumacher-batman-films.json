This franchise consists of four films released between 1989 and 1997, characterized by a darker, gothic tone under Burton's direction and a more colorful, campy style during Schumacher's tenure. The films include elements of action, drama, and fantasy, and helped reshape the superhero film genre during the late 20th century."

It was followed by **Batman Returns** in 1992, also directed by Burton. In 1995, Joel Schumacher took over the director's chair with **Batman Forever**, introducing a more colorful and less dark iteration of Gotham City.

The films received varying degrees of acclaim and have since become notable entries in the history of Batman on film."
