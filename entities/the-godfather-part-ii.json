      "body": "The Godfather Part II is the sequel to the iconic 1972 film The Godfather. Directed and co-written by Francis Ford Coppola with Mario Puzo, the film was released in 1974 and serves as both a sequel and a prequel. It chronicles two parallel narratives: the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the new Don of the Corleone crime family, and the backstory of his father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), depicting his childhood in Sicily and his immigrant life in New York City’s Little Italy. The film blends these timelines to explore themes of power, family, and legacy."
