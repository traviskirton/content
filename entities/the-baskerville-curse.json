It operates as a psychological threat influencing characters’ behavior and motivations, shaping the plot’s unfolding mystery. The curse’s lore serves to heighten tension and create an ominous atmosphere, while simultaneously setting the stage for Sherlock Holmes’s rational detective work to demystify the truth."

    {
      "title": "History",
      "body": "The curse dates back several centuries to Sir Hugo Baskerville, whose wicked and brutal actions—particularly the abduction and subsequent death linked to a moorland chase—are believed to have initiated a supernatural family doom. The spectral hound is said to be the curse’s physical enforcer, a ghostly avenger punishing descendants for ancestral misdeeds. Over generations, the curse has evolved into both a local legend and a psychological millstone, affecting the family’s fortunes and the beliefs of those around them."
