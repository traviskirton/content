It functions as the personal retreat and operational headquarters for Michael Corleone during the events of The Godfather Part II. This luxurious property is emblematic of the Corleone family's power and wealth, blending natural beauty with opulent architecture, and serving as a private sanctuary away from the public eye and the violence of urban life. It is designed to be both a family home and a fortress of sorts, where Michael conducts critical business and contemplates his fading innocence."
