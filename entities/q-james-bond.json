      "body": "**Q** is the code name for the quartermaster of the British Secret Service (MI6), best known as the inventive genius behind the gadgets and high-tech equipment that James Bond uses. The character originated from the title \"Quartermaster\" and was first introduced in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and subsequently adapted for the film series. Over time, 'Q' became the nickname and primary identity of the character.\n\nThough the personal background and early life of Q are seldom detailed in the films or books, he is typically portrayed as a British technical expert, scientist, and engineer. His position at MI6 involves ensuring that field agents like Bond are equipped with innovative and often unconventional tools that aid in espionage and combat.\n\nMultiple actors have portrayed Q, with significant portrayals by Desmond Llewelyn (the classic Q), John Cleese (as his assistant and successor), and Ben Whishaw (the modern incarnation starting from the Daniel Craig era)."
