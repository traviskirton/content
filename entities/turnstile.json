    {
      "title": "Overview",
      "body": "The Turnstile is a critical device in the film 'Tenet', functioning as a mechanism to invert the entropy of objects or people, allowing them to move backward through time. Its primary purpose is to enable time inversion, which is crucial for the characters to alter past events and influence the future."
    },
    {
      "title": "Appearance",
      "body": "Physically, the Turnstile resembles a large chamber or vault divided by a translucent, rotating barrier. One side contains surrounded entry and exit points, resembling a high-security installation of futuristic design."
    },
    {
      "title": "Function",
      "body": "The Turnstile works by forcing objects or people to 'invert' their entropy. When a person passes through, they begin to experience time in reverse relative to the regular flow of time; effect and cause can appear reversed to those not inverted. This process is crucial for strategic manipulation of events in 'Tenet'."
    },
    {
      "title": "History",
      "body": "In the narrative of 'Tenet', the Turnstile is a technology developed in the future and sent back in time. The exact origins of its creation remain shrouded in mystery, aligning with the film's overarching theme of temporal complexity and the intertwining of past, present, and future."

    {
      "title": "Story Significance",
      "body": "Turnstiles are central to the plot of 'Tenet'. They are used by both protagonist and antagonist forces to gain the upper hand in manipulating reality. Key scenes involving the Turnstile include reverse action sequences and pivotal confrontations that reveal and conceal critical plot points."
