    {
      "title": "Appearance",
      "body": "The device appears as a large, elaborate holographic projector or a table, emitting intricate three-dimensional patterns of light that represent complex mathematical models and timelines. Its display is dynamic and interactive, showing possible futures as overlapping vectors and changing flows that expert mentalics can interpret with clarity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Function",
      "body": "Serving as the core tool for psychohistorical analysis, the Prime Radiant allows users to input current galactic data, simulate Seldon Plan trajectories, and evaluate deviations or disruptions. It combines computational power with mentalic feedback from Second Foundation mentalics to update and refine predictions continuously."
    },
    {
      "title": "History",
      "body": "Developed in the early days of Hari Seldon's Foundation project, the Prime Radiant was indispensable for maintaining the Seldon Plan through centuries of galactic upheaval. Its secrecy and restricted access have been closely guarded by the Second Foundation to prevent misuse or destruction by adversaries."
