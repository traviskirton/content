      "title": "Background",
      "body": "Joey Zasa is introduced in The Godfather Part III as a powerful and aggressive mob boss who attempts to take over territory traditionally controlled by the Corleone family. Unlike the old generation of mafia dons, Zasa exhibits brashness and a readiness to use extreme violence to get what he wants. His shadowy dealings and disregard for tradition mark him as a dangerous new force in the evolving criminal underworld of New York."
    },
    {
      "title": "Personality",
      "body": "Zasa is characterized by his arrogance, impatience, and violent tendencies. He is ruthless in pursuit of power and lacks the subtlety and restraint shown by older mafiosi like Michael Corleone. His brash approach often leads to reckless decisions, exposing both his ambition and vulnerability. Zasa is combative and ostentatious, striving to assert dominance and provoke fear through intimidation and brutality."

      "title": "Story Role",
      "body": "In the narrative of The Godfather Part III, Joey Zasa serves as the primary antagonist representing the new generation of violent, power-hungry criminals threatening the Corleone legacy. His vendetta against the Corleones triggers violent confrontations, escalating the tension throughout the film’s storyline. Zasa’s direct clashes with Michael Corleone culminate in bloody skirmishes and ultimately his downfall, illustrating the costs and perils of mafia rivalry."

      "title": "Relationships",
      "body": "Joey Zasa is an adversary of the Corleone family, particularly targeting Michael Corleone’s control and interests. He associates with other unsavory characters and factions aiming to wrest power from established families. His antagonism isolates him from old allies and aligns him with opportunistic criminals. Though often acting alone, Zasa’s conflicts create ripple effects through mafia networks, contributing to shifting alliances and gang warfare."

    {
      "title": "Abilities/Skills",
      "body": "Zasa exhibits tactical aggression and leadership in his criminal operations. His willingness to employ violence and intimidation marks him as a formidable opponent. Unlike more strategic mafiosi, his strengths lie in brute force and direct action rather than subtle manipulation. He commands respect through fear and demonstrates a keen sense of opportunism, but his impulsiveness often undermines his long-term success."
