      "title": "Background",
      "body": "Hyman Roth is a major figure in organized crime, originating from Jewish immigrant roots and expanding his influence globally. In the 1950s setting of The Godfather Part II, Roth is deeply involved in large-scale criminal operations including gambling and narcotics. His refined approach to business contrasts with the Corleones’ traditional methods but shares the ruthless pragmatism characteristic of high-level mobsters. His character is inspired by real-life mobsters such as Meyer Lansky, embodying the calculated, sophisticated side of organized crime."

    {
      "title": "Personality",
      "body": "Roth is calm, intelligent, and diplomatic, often hiding his brutal nature behind a veneer of civility and charm. He is manipulative, patient, and highly strategic, preferring to operate through negotiation and influence rather than overt violence when possible. Despite his age, he commands respect and remains a powerful force in the criminal world. His demeanor masks a deadly cunning and willingness to betray if it suits his purposes."

      "title": "Story Role",
      "body": "In the narrative, Roth is Michael Corleone’s business partner but also his adversary. Their alliance slowly crumbles amid betrayal, power struggles, and a complicated web of negotiations linked to Cuba and its political turmoil. Roth’s attempts to undermine Michael and seize control of lucrative enterprises drive much of the film’s tension, highlighting themes of trust, loyalty, and the fragile nature of partnerships within the underworld."

      "body": "Roth has a complex relationship with Michael Corleone, involving mutual benefit yet deep-seated suspicion and rivalry. He employs intermediaries, such as Frank Pentangeli, for influence and negotiation. Roth's network extends internationally, and his longstanding ties and reputation make him a formidable foe and powerful ally in the criminal world."
