Below them are the freemen, the common riders who form the bulk of the cavalry forces. The social structure is closely tied to horse-keeping and martial skill, with leadership based partly on lineage and military ability. The Rohirrim gather under their banner in times of war, showcasing remarkable unity."

Throughout history, they have played pivotal roles in defending the western lands from invasion, notably during the War of the Ring. Their alliance with Gondor and their fierce defense of their realm helped turn the tide against Sauron’s forces, highlighted by the Battle of the Pelennor Fields where their cavalry charge was decisive."
