Unlike the secretive Second Foundation agents, Palver operates openly within political structures, advocating for First Foundation interests.

      "title": "Story Role",
      "body": "In 'Second Foundation,' Palver functions as a foil to the covert manipulations originating from the Second Foundation. His quest to uncover and confront the secretive socio-psychological influences exemplifies the tension between overt authority and hidden powers. His actions catalyze key plot developments, as his interactions reveal cracks in the political landscape and challenge the hidden psychic dominance of the Second Foundation."

    {
      "title": "Relationships",
      "body": "Palver’s relationships are primarily political, involving alliances and rivalries within the First Foundation’s leadership ranks. He is wary of mentalic individuals and suspects their influence extends beyond comprehension, including those associated with @@Pelleas Anthor@@. Despite these tensions, he occasionally seeks to engage with or expose the Second Foundation’s agents, motivated by his dedication to transparency and governance."

    {
      "title": "Abilities/Skills",
