      "title": "Appearance",
      "body": "The chamber is described as dimly lit and sparsely furnished with an iron bedstead and leather-bound chairs. The walls are adorned with grotesque trophies and exotic animal heads collected during Roylott's time in India. A strange ventilator connects the chamber to the adjacent room, and a bell-pull that serves no actual bell hangs by the bed, all designed to conceal the method of attack. These features give the chamber an exotic, hostile character filled with lurking menace."

He modified this chamber secretly to accommodate a snake known as the swamp adder, which he trained to use for attacks. The presence of the ventilator and fake bell cord was part of a calculated scheme to murder while maintaining plausible deniability, reflecting his cold and cruel ingenuity."
