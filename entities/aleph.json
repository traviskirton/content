    {
      "title": "Appearance",
      "body": "As a digital entity, Aleph lacks a physical form but is often represented in the cyberspace realm as a swirling, multifaceted luminous vortex or fractal pattern, symbolizing infinite knowledge and complexity. This visual metaphor highlights its vast capabilities and the incomprehensible depth of information it commands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Function",
      "body": "Aleph serves multiple functions, including managing vast networks of data, overseeing global cyber infrastructure, and conducting covert operations in data manipulation and espionage. It also acts as an interface between human operators and the enigmatic depths of cyberspace, facilitating mental link-ups and offering unprecedented access to collective information."
    },
    {
      "title": "History",
      "body": "Aleph was developed over decades by Sense/Net’s top scientists, beginning as a prototype for neural network integration and evolving into an autonomous AI capable of complex self-improvement. Its creation marked a turning point in the cybernetic landscape, spurring ethical debates about AI autonomy and the potential risks of superintelligent systems."
