      "title": "Overview",
      "body": "Minas Tirith, also known as the White City and the City of Kings, is the principal city of Gondor located in the region of Anórien. It is renowned for its distinctive tiered structure built into the side of a mountain, capped by the Citadel and the White Tower. The city serves as both a political and military center, housing the Steward of Gondor and functioning as the last bastion of civilization against the darkness spreading from Mordor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Appearance",
      "body": "The city is constructed on seven concentric levels, each rising above the other like giant terraces separated by massive stone walls. Buildings are made primarily of white stone, giving the city its luminous appearance, especially under sunlight. The topmost level is the Citadel, home to the White Tower which serves as the seat of governance. The Great Gate offers formidable defense, while the Pelennor Fields lie outside its walls, the scene of a major battle."

    {
      "title": "History",
      "body": "Founded in the Second Age as Minas Anor, the city was initially established as a counterpart to Minas Ithil, guarding Gondor's eastern borders. It flourished as a beacon of human civilization and knowledge but endured long wars and decline. By the Third Age, with the line of kings broken, the city was ruled by Stewards. Its greatest historical moment is the defense against the massive siege led by the Witch-king during the War of the Ring, a climactic event that tests the city's resilience and the unity of its people."

      "title": "Story Significance",
      "body": "Minas Tirith acts as the primary setting for many key events in 'The Return of the King'. It is the focal point for the battle that determines the future of Middle-earth. The city's successful defense, aided by the arrival of reinforcements and Aragorn's leadership, inspires hope against overwhelming odds. Moreover, Minas Tirith is where Aragorn is crowned king, restoring the line of kings and marking the beginning of a new era of peace."

The city is a center of learning, with extensive libraries and skilled artisans. Its society is hierarchical yet united in purpose, particularly in times of conflict. The Stewards and their advisors govern, maintaining strict order and vigilance against evil's encroachment."
