# Tag System Analysis & Improvement Prompt

## Current System Description (for LLM context)

This knowledge base contains 913 entity JSON files representing people, movies, books, characters, and locations. Each entity has a `tags` array containing freeform string tags for categorization and filtering.

### Structure
- Tags are stored as `"tags": ["tag1", "tag2", ...]` in each entity JSON
- Schema defines tags as optional string arrays with no controlled vocabulary
- Typical entity has 4-10 tags

### Current Tag Statistics
- **1,735 unique tags** across 913 entities
- High variability in formatting (case, hyphenation, spacing)
- Tags serve multiple overlapping purposes

### Observed Tag Categories

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Genre | sci-fi, drama, fantasy, thriller | Content classification |
| Role | protagonist, antagonist, mentor, villain | Character function |
| Era | 1950s, modern, Victorian era, Cold War | Temporal context |
| Occupation | actor, director, writer, composer | Person classification |
| Franchise | The Godfather, James Bond, Middle-earth | Series grouping |
| Theme | espionage, dreams, time-travel, corruption | Conceptual clustering |
| Location Type | city, country, building, fictional | Place classification |
| Status | active, public, tours-available | Property flags |

### Known Inconsistencies

1. **Case variations**: "Fantasy" vs "fantasy", "Science Fiction" vs "sci-fi"
2. **Hyphenation**: "time-travel" vs "time travel", "mind-bending" vs potential variants
3. **Redundant concepts**: "sci-fi", "science fiction", "Science Fiction" all exist
4. **Mixed naming**: "christopher-nolan" (hyphenated slug) vs "Christopher Nolan" (display name)
5. **Singular/plural**: "Dwarves" vs "Dwarf", "Elves" vs "Elf"

### How Tags Are Used
- Generated by AI during entity creation with instruction "generate 5-8 relevant tags"
- No validation or normalization applied
- Used for filtering and discovering related content
- Relationships between entities exist separately (not via tags)

## Brainstorming Prompt

You are helping improve a tagging system for a knowledge base of entertainment entities (movies, books, characters, actors, locations).

**Context:** The current system has 1,735 unique tags across 913 entities with significant inconsistencies. Tags are freeform strings with no controlled vocabulary or validation.

**Goals for improvement:**
1. Better discoverability and filtering
2. Consistency without losing expressiveness
3. Support for faceted search (filter by multiple dimensions)
4. Clear semantics (what does each tag mean?)

**Constraints:**
- Must work with existing JSON structure
- Should be automatable (AI can apply rules during generation)
- Backward compatible migration path preferred
- Don't over-engineer—this is a personal knowledge base, not enterprise software

**Current pain points:**
- Same concept has multiple tag variants (case, hyphenation, synonyms)
- Hard to know what tags exist when creating new entities
- Tags conflate different concerns (genre, era, theme, role all mixed together)
- No hierarchy (can't say "cyberpunk is a subgenre of sci-fi")

**Brainstorm the following:**

1. **Normalization rules**: What conventions should all tags follow? (case, spacing, compound words, proper nouns)

2. **Category separation**: Should tags be split into typed categories (genre tags, era tags, theme tags)? Or kept flat with prefixes? Or something else?

3. **Controlled vocabulary**: Should there be a master list of approved tags? How would it be maintained? What about new tags?

4. **Hierarchy/relationships**: Is tag hierarchy worth the complexity? How might it work?

5. **Migration strategy**: How to normalize 1,735 existing tags? Automated mapping? Manual review? Hybrid?

6. **Generation guidance**: What instructions should the AI get when creating new entities to ensure consistent tagging?

7. **Alternative approaches**: Are tags even the right abstraction? What about facets, categories, or other metadata patterns?

Think creatively. Propose 2-3 different approaches ranging from minimal changes to more ambitious restructuring. For each, explain tradeoffs.
